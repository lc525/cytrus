*** Note:

This code is written as part of my B.Sc. Thesis.
Please feel free to comment/send me suggestions or develop your own branches
from my code. I will try to post here the progress of my work, as well as
references to important articles in the field.

My B.Sc Thesis focuses on real-time object recognition (in video data), as an
aplication of the SURF algorithm, implemented on CPU, as well as GPU - CUDA).
The SURF algorithm should be used in the end as a first step in 3D object
modelling. [out of scope for the time being]

The interface of the application will be written in WPF/C# , and as such will
not be portable to linux environments. (This is due to my lack of knowledge/
experience in the GTK++ area, and the lack of time) 

Despite this, the library implementing the SURF algorithm is written in C++,
and will be tested on both windows/linux before release.

Practically, for making the whole application work under linux, one must write
two OS-specific layers: 
(i)  the Camera HAL Layer (image acquisition; using DirectShow on Windows)
(ii) the Presentation Layer (GUI; using WPF on Windows).
