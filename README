*** Note:

While this will develop to be my B.Sc Thesis (and as a result
I can't be assisted by others in writing the code), please feel free 
to comment/send me suggestions or develop your own branches from my code.
I will try to post here the progress of my work, as well as references to
important articles in the field.

Momentarley, my B.Sc Thesis will concentrate on object recognition, as an aplication
of the SURF algorithm, implemented on CPU, as well as GPU - CUDA).
The SURF algorithm will be then used as a first step in 3D object modelling.
