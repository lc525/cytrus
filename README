*** Note:

[! The Repository Code is yet incomplete, as i perform the integration of various prototype implementations ]

While this will develop to be my B.Sc Thesis (and as a result
I can't be assisted by others in writing the code), please feel free 
to comment/send me suggestions or develop your own branches from my code.
I will try to post here the progress of my work, as well as references to
important articles in the field.

Momentarily, my B.Sc Thesis will concentrate on object recognition, as an aplication
of the SURF algorithm, implemented on CPU, as well as GPU - CUDA).
The SURF algorithm will be then used as a first step in 3D object modelling. [out of scope for the time being]

The interface of the application will be written in WPF/C# , and as such will not be portable on linux environments. (This is due to my lack of knowledge/experience in the GTK++ area, and the small amout of available time)
Despite this, the library implementing the SURF algorithm is written in C++, and it will be tested on both windows/linux before release.

Practically, for making the whole application work under linux, one must write 2 SO-specific layers: the Camera HAL Layer (for image aquisition from cameras, currently using DirectShow under Windows) and the Presentation Layer (for displaying the results, currently using WPF under Windows).
