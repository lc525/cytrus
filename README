*** Note:

This code is written as part of my B.Sc. Thesis.
Please feel free to comment/send me suggestions or develop your own branches from my code.
I will try to post here the progress of my work, as well as references to
important articles in the field.

My B.Sc Thesis focuses on real-time object recognition (in video data), as an aplication
of the SURF algorithm, implemented on CPU, as well as GPU - CUDA).
The SURF algorithm should be used in the end as a first step in 3D object modelling.
[out of scope for the time being]

The interface of the application will be written in WPF/C# , and as such will not be portable on linux environments. 
(This is due to my lack of knowledge/experience in the GTK++ area, and the small amout of available time)
Despite this, the library implementing the SURF algorithm is written in C++, and it will be tested on both windows/linux 
before release.

Practically, for making the whole application work under linux, one must write 2 SO-specific layers: the Camera HAL Layer 
(for image aquisition from cameras, currently using DirectShow on Windows) and the Presentation Layer (for displaying 
the results, currently using WPF on Windows).
