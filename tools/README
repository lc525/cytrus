*** Note:

While this will develop to be my B.Sc Thesis (and as a result
I can't be assisted by others in writing the code), please feel free 
to comment/send me suggestions or develop your own branches from my code.
I will try to post here the progress of my work, as well as references to
important articles in the field.
